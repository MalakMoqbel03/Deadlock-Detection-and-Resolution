# Deadlock-Detection-and-Resolution
 This project implements a deadlock detection and resolution system for a multi-resource environment. It reads allocation, request, and available resource data from input files, verifies consistency, detects deadlocks, and, if no deadlock is found, provides a safe execution sequence for processes.
